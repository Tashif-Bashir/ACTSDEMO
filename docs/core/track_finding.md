## Machine-Learning based Track Finding

There is a lot of research ongoing about machine-learning based approaches to Track Finding. Because these are not yet stable and bullet-prove, there are no such algorithms distributed with the core library. However, there exists a plugin, that implements the **Exa.TrkX** algorithm in ACTS.
