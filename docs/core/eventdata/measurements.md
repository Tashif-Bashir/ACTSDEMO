# Measurements

Measurements exist as *uncalibrated* and *calibrated* types. *Uncalibrated*
measurements are the direct output of the data formation. *Calibrated*
measurements are used during track fitting. When trajectory information
(or information about the trajectory hypothesis) is available, certain calibration
steps can help to improve the track fit quality.
