// @brief Base class for host memory allocation.
// 
// This is based on `std::pmr::memory_resource`:
// https:// en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/memory_resource
// 
// This class serves as the interface that all host memory resource
// implementations must satisfy.
// 
// There are two private, pure virtual functions that all derived classes must
// implement: `doAllocate` and `doDeallocate`. Optionally, derived classes may
// also override `isEqual`. By default, `isEqual` simply performs an identity
// comparison.
// 
// The public, non-virtual functions `allocate`, `deallocate`, and `isEqual`
// simply call the private virtual functions. The reason for this is to allow
// implementing shared, default behavior in the base class. For example, the
// base class' `allocate` function may log every allocation, no matter what
// derived class implementation is used.
